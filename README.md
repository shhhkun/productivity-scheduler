## Known Bugs/Issues

- Rank up notification will sometimes persist/stay
    - Potential Cause(s): large influx of XP at once, de-leveling
- Streak counter stuck at 0 days
    - will be fixed later on once multiday scheduling is implemented

## Notes

- XP/streak logic currently only updates on task checkmarks.
- Streak logic tied to calendar day rollover ‚Äî better UX needed.
