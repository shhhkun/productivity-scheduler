## Roadmap

- [x] Sticky XP bar w/ responsive layout
- [x] Achievements & title system (e.g., ‚ÄúTask Apprentice‚Äù)
- [ ] Task history or log view
- [ ] Optional streak mechanic modes (daily, 3-day/week, etc.)
- [x] Animation polish (reduce layout shift on reordering)
- [ ] Data persistence via `localStorage`
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Dark mode toggle

---

## Known Bugs/Issues

- [] Rank up notification will sometimes persist/stay
    - [X] Potential Cause: large influx of XP at once, de-leveling
    - [ ] New Cause: after page refresh, rank up notification is static (likely tied to data persistence) 
- [ ] Streak counter stuck at 0 days
    - will be fixed later on once data persistence and user login is implemented

## Notes

- XP/streak logic currently only updates on task checkmarks.
- Streak logic tied to calendar day rollover ‚Äî better UX needed.
- Animation tuning ongoing (e.g., card bounce, modal scale)
- Refactorable code later on:
    - rankbadge.jsx and badgedisplay.jsx were refactored, possibly remove badgedisplay later on
    - level states and event handlers
- Clean up code structure:
    - Ordering of state variables
    - Ordering of useEffect()'s
    - Order of functions
- Clean up Login UI
- Add logout feature
